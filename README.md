# The Metric System

After a long discussion with wikipedia today I decided I'm sick and tired of hearing how ["the US is the only industrialized nation that does not mainly use the metric system in its commercial and standards activities"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units).   So I went and made a rubygem to solve it.   Or maybe I had a different goal, the jury is out after all, it being a weekend.

The **Metric System (tm)** is most probably an attempt to generate simple, quick metrics without any fancy reporting, or other bits.  It is currently in early alpha shape at version 2.3.4.
